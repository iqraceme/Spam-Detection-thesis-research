2006-7,14-Jul-06,JKknzjO2zv3wa,8dMYOnvaYRsOWgUJSOgzrA,"I Pricelined a hotel in the loop and ended up with the Palmer House for a last minute trip to Chicago on June 2 - June 6. Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House.

2007-5,12-May-07,LnZ6EZBdviLT6Shf5GjQnw,V7N4zvbBz4xz_NCTRm-yfA,"If you're looking to spend a lot of time in your room, you probably won't like the Palmer House. The rooms are fairly small, though certainly clean and well appointed. I stayed in a single room -- which is to say it had one double bed -- and it probably wasn't much bigger than your bedroom at home. Depends on your home, of course. And it's hard to judge, since in addition to the bed, there was a desk with a chair, a no-longer-in-service minibar, a side table, and an armoire with a TV. More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger. But if you're staying in downtown Chicago, what are you doing staying in your room? So what if it's small -- it's within walking distance of everything. Get out! Also, the Palmer House has an honest to goodness lobby, where you can sit and relax and have a drink and even eat, depending on the time of day. And it's a huge and beautiful lobby. So if your room is small, but you don't want to leave the hotel, and you aren't completely afraid of other people, hang out in the lobby. The Palmer House was built at a time when people socialized. They enjoyed it, even! Socialize. The registration area is surprisingly tiny, and the hotel is undergoing renovations, so only one entrance is available (on Monroe) and some areas are blocked off. The hotel is a destination spot for proms and business meetings/conventions/seminars, so be prepared for some congestion. And elevators are slow. But these are minor quibbles in a grand old hotel. Don't expect the latest Vegas luxury resort, and you'll be fine. An historical side note: the chef at the Palmer House invented the brownie, more than 100 years ago. The Palmer House still sells their signature brownies. At 10 bucks a pop. I passed.",4,6,2,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2007,5,2007-5

2008-8,16-Aug-08,0AobeQFCa8CpDL3tIaFwzA,omJUEayO0J0UfNEpW3QnTw,"Busy, busy, busy.  I think I counted seven large events going on at the Palmer House during the two nights we were there.  Think a medley of professional salsa dancers, junior high cheer squads, and large wedding parties.  I found that most of this activity was contained on the first few floors and didn't really translate to much traffic in our hallway. I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door. Bottom line: if you get a good price, go for it.",4,3,3,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2008,8,2008-8

2008-8,08-Aug-08,T-EFDEWkeZFFTdbOg7QYOA,tWBHvMmO0jkdN2T_sJBkxw,"Something always seems to go wrong when I visit Chicago, last time our car got towed at 2am (course our luggage, maps & most $ was in the car ) so we had to wander the streets of Chicago aimlessly... This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a ""do not disturb"" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am! (which, to someone on PST felt like 6:30am wakeup, esp. after being at a wedding reception until midnight the night before!). SUN.   3:14am woken by screaming fight next door (apparently some jerk ditched his GF).   7:00am woken up by someone in the room on the other side decided it was a good time to SING. 8:30-9:30am Maid knocking on neighbouring doors woke us up later that morning (we'd finally learned to put the do not disturb (or polish our door!) sign up at night). Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.",2,0,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2008,8,2008-8

2009-1,15-Jan-09,8pkIdOuQf6pTAt2p2FV2HQ,Dr5Ur42YH2oxGIGNY6ylkA,I spent New Year's Eve here and had a spectacular time! First the bar in the lobby had some great drinks. The empire room didn't have anything going on so my date and I went in and talked and slow danced and then went for more drinks. We didn't make reservations for dinner so had dinner at the Lockwood. Great service. My food was okay and my date's was phnomenal! He took me on a tour of the place and told me about some of the history. And of course the lobby is breathtaking. I'm not so sure why so many people are unhappy with their rooms because there's so much to do outside of the room - how much time do you really spend in there? We spent about 5 hours total between getting ready and having breakfast and a catchin a few zzzzz's. The bed was sooo comfortable! And the showers get really hot and have good water pressure. It was enough room for two people to relax and not feel cramped. My only gripe is that we ordered some room service and we paid $40 for 4 half sized diet cokes on ice. And heads up! Any room service you order there is a fee and a tip added on for you.... I caught myself tipping my breakfast guy $5+.

2009-10,02-Oct-09,9T9jysrm5fqsoKda5iffjw,jHmlmozty9ifc9qjkuHsoA,"Despite the fact that the lobby is quite nice, my room is huge, and I got a reasonably priced air/hotel package, I just can't give this hotel more than 2 stars. I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the ""off"" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11"", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the ""guest service hotline"" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the ""hotline"". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.",2,9,2,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2009,10,2009-10

I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk).

Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving.

The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved.  You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in.  My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us.  I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted.  The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have.  It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties.  The TV was extremely dated.  No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it. And they charge for the use of the gym!!!!!! Seriously? How can you give your customer subpar accommodations & claim to be a luxury hotel?

Everything is beautiful with high open ceilings, historic woodwork and molding, great fixtures and tapestries. This is definitely a historic place in Chicago that anyone visiting should see.The hotel is close to many great things in Chicago. We came to see a concert at the Chicago Theater and it was an easy walk to there.I'm giving it three stars because we booked our room online and it was supposed to be 2 queens. When we arrived, we were notified that they had awarded all the 2 Queen bedrooms to Hilton Honors members and all they had left was single King rooms. I was with a relative, and we decided we could bare sleeping together for one night. When we arrived in the room, it looked as though this was at one time a janitor's closet converted to a bedroom. The room was absolutely tiny. Our bed took up most of the room and there was very little space to walk around or place our bags. The mini-fridge didn't even open all the way because it hit the end of the bed. Plus, our mini-fridge wasn't even working.Sooo....unless you're a Hilton Honor's member, I would be leery of booking rooms here. There are no guarantees and it definitely felt like they treated people who booked from on-line discount sites (such as http://hotels.com) as second class citizens.

2010-11,17-Nov-10,NlmdKg9px1fDh8kuPOeQ-A,3QhuMZBKdz2-fRvVTCWizA,"When we got engaged, we planned our wedding almost exactly a year out.  Being a perfectionist and very organized, I started searching through bridal magazines and websites to plan our wedding.  I saw the Palmer House on the first day of looking at venues and knew that was where we would have our wedding.  Looking into the Grand & State Ballrooms just took my breath away.  We got married on Saturday, June 5th, 2010 at the Palmer House Hilton Chicago. We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said ""no problem"" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said ""no problem"" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard ""sorry we're booked"".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She ""WOWED"" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together!

This hotel was one of the worst I have stayed at in terms of convenience. Big giant old tv in the room. NO fridge. Tiny room for over $200/night. I was here for a corporate event, and even the customers who came to visit during the day were complaining about the confusing layout of the hotel. Its ornate and beautiful, but that's about it. There are two places to eat at the hotel, that's it. One is closed during the day. So, one place to eat. ""Good luck getting breakfast"" the lady at the front counter joked no too long ago. She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get ""wifi"" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later. There is no one after me staying in the room, but, apparently it is hotel policy to Charge $50 if you check out at 1pm. This place is a joke. DO NOT STAY HERE. Instead, check out an air bnb, that's what I'm doing for the rest of my trip here :) Oh, also... This place is haunted... Heard multiple people say they heard whispers ;) PS: Paris Hilton sucks too.

I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review.

2012-1,06-Jan-12,Z5TMUHIT3-WZqCR-xAIEDA,EjRUFL0aoORBMfsmmkF3Qw,"Giving this hotel only two stars breaks my heart. I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers. So maybe the moral of the story is...stay at the Palmer House but on a concierge floor. That's a solution I could live with.",2,1,2,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,1,2012-1

The open sitting area near the bar is comfortable and welcoming. There are bar tables off to one side with iPad's in upright holders, for anyone's entertainment. Bonus...they lowered their valet prices, which is nice, since the hotel rooms are quite pricey. At least you don't have to take it up the yin yang from all directions.

The hotel has three exits/entrances that give you access to three different streets so you are steps away from public transportation, the Berghoff, Millenium Park, and basically anywhere else downtown. The rooms are hit or miss. I have stayed in rooms that were updated and modern. I have also stayed in rooms that were old and dreary-looking. I will say that all of the rooms are very clean so that is always a major plus. The only reasons this hotel doesn't get a 5-star review are because they don't offer free wifi in the room (they charge $7.50 per HOUR to get access in your room), they charge $10 per day to use the fitness center even for hotel guests, and not all of the rooms are renovated. These are all major shortcomings of the hotel but I still love the Palmer House. The Palmer House will always be my preferred place to stay in the city because of the aforementioned benefits that this hotel provides.",4,6,2,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,7,2012-7

You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah. Also, enjoyed a wonderful and filling lunch at Lockwood Restaurant in the lobby.  Try the Ahi Tuna burger and fries.....do yourself the favor, you deserve it! :)",4,2,3,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,7,2012-7

Having said that, this isn't a bad place.  The staff is nice,  beds are super comfy, the place is very clean (though some of the areas are a bit worn) and the location is awesome.  This place is giant...with so many wings you may get lost going to your room.   You are very close to Millennium Park, the waterfront, theaters, even the Miracle Mile is a short walk away.  The lobby is truly breath-taking.  But it's not all lollipops and unicorns....the breakfast offered on the Executive Level is incredibly weak.  Oatmeal is the only hot food offered and the set up is almost aggressively inefficient.  Speaking of inefficient, you'll spend more time waiting for the elevators than sleeping in your bed.     I've stayed here twice and my first room was very tiny, but my second room was nice and spacious. If you get a good deal, it's definitely worth staying here.   I also think it's funny that the Palmer House is located a few blocks from Wacker Drive, but that's just because I'm incredibly immature.",3,1,0,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,7,2012-7

I thought that price was pretty good for early summer.  It's located right near the blue line (easy to get to after you arrive at the airport) and it's between most other loop lines (easy to get around the rest of the city).  The place touts itself for its history within the city and the performers it has hosted.  This is to say, good first impression. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgraded room with a king sized bed for $49 more.  We opted not to upgrade and they gave us an upgrade to a queen sized bed for free-- nice touch!  Our room was spacious, though it had one chair, a desk, and a TV stand along with the bed in the sleeping area leaving it looking empty.  The bathroom was on the smaller side, but it had some nice Peter Thomas Roth bath products.  However, the bathtub was majorly clogged.  Sad.   Outside of that, the room I had faced east, and the room filled with sunlight no matter how tightly I drew the blinds.  It made it hard to sleep past 7am.  As far as the rest of the hotel, the staff and front desk were friendly and helpful.  Checkout was easy, and we were able to leave our bags with the hotel for a couple hours before catching our train to the next destination.   So, the Palmer House was nice.  I wasn't blown away, but I was happy most of the time there.    In all my traveling experiences, I think it's worth staying if you can get it for under $150.",3,1,2,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,7,2012-7
2012-7,16-Jul-12,aUlO2DNV7LQIdF8T7QS4jw,KeuhteHe76DxDlXnkWoDwA,"The room I stayed in on the 13th floor was quite comfy. 2 of the 3 nights I passed out in the king size bed with various items (ie room service menu, cell phone, etc) scattered around me. The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict. Not absolutely mind-blowing, but pretty near perfect. Only downside to the room service is that the 'late night kitchen' closes at midnight.

The hotel is very large and the floors can be a little bit of a maze. Overall I would stay here again based on the price, location, and acceptability of the rooms, so I guess I will go with four stars.",4,1,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw,2012,7,2012-7
2012-7,14-Jul-12,bQRv,sEJWAGJakJ0LD8QsnSrYcw,"I wanted to enjoy this hotel so much, because I love classic architecture and the location of the hotel is amazing. You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening.

The hallways of the rooms promintently display black-and-white photos of the stars of the ""golden age"" - singers, musicians, actors of all kinds grace the silent hallways. There appears to have been some renovation based on other reviews and the curtains of other rooms I noticed from my window.  My room on the 17th floor was quite lovely - art deco furniture, lovely colors, ""Hollywood-style"" decorative bathroom and closet door handles were a reminder of a past golden age. A few minor annoyances - no coffee maker in my room (big, huge boo for a business traveler.)  The buttons on the phone didn't connect to... well, anywhere (wake up calls, etc.) No free internet except in the lobby (which seems to be pretty typical these days.)  The instructions for the check out process are incorrect and you can't set a time for checkout.  So, I accidentally checked out when I wasn't ready to leave for a few hours (in conference meetings all morning.)  The phone operator didn't understand this predicament and kept forwarding me to non-answering numbers.

If it were just me and my husband for a weekend, I might give it 4 or even 5 stars, because -It's beautiful -The rooms are lovely and clean, albeit a bit dark -Beds are super clean and comfy -Great location -Friendly, helpful bell staff -Great room deal However, I was arranging lodging for my wedding party with 5 rooms. The very cool and detached attitude by the staff left me nervous that my older/international guests would have problems with the impersonal service or that the end of my stay would be marred by a billing problem . We booked 5 rooms for myself and my wedding party and our guests booked another 6-7 rooms. When we booked and paid for the 5 rooms, I asked if any of the rooms had  a mini-fridge (for my cake) and the front desk agent looked past me and said, ""no that's an extra $40/night""  After spending $2500, I felt a little put out.  Later, I was checking a room quote for a friend and noticed that the rate for an executive level room was just $15 more a night. I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option. The final resolution was a free upgrade for myself and the assurance that the concierge was available to handle any needs I had.   I needed to change the names on a couple rooms and each time I called the Front Desk, I was on hold for 20 minutes.  Each conversation started witht he agent telling me they couldn't change it because I booked it elsewhere, then I would insist that I confirmed and PAID at the Palmer directly, more time on hold, and then changing the name. Finally, I emailed a list of guests to the concierge a couple days before the event, in case people got lost or had a problem with their reservation. It was met with radio silence.

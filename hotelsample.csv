First off, the place is massive! There's a whole shopping arcade in the ground floor level including the righteous Merz Apothecary. Ascend the glorious staircase to the extravagantly decorated lobby and admire the decor while sipping a cocktail at the turn of the century bar. If you're really feeling opulent, there's high tea on the weekends. The location can't be beat - it's right in the heart of the Loop, close to the historic Marshall Fields building (now sadly a craptastic Macy's). Whether you stay here or just stop in to admire this architectural gem, you'll be transported back in time. Maybe you'll meet your own Jimmy Darmody here....you never know.",5,1,2,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Here's all the details: The hotel is just gorgeous inside.  The main lobby area has a really high ceiling and you can tell that a lot of time and detail was put into this hotel.  There is a bar and lounge area which is just as nice.  This is not a modern and trendy hotel, it is an elegant hotel.   Service is phenomenal as well.  The front desk was so kind to me and understanding that I was freaking out because it was my boyfriend's 30th birthday and I wanted everything to be perfect.  I called to ask them to put some more ice on the champagne in our room because dinner ran late and they did, no questions asked!   The rooms are really nice and you can tell that everything is of good quality.   It is a large hotel, so sometimes the elevator may take an extra minute or the line to check in at exact check in time might be long, but it is all worth it.  It's in a great location as well, right in the downtown loop area.  Walking distance to almost anything your hear desires.   Take a cab everywhere that's far if you're from out of town so you don't get lost on the wrong train.  :)   I have been here for a wedding before and that was amazing as well.   The hotel is a bit pricey, but worth it.",5,0,1,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

For Labor Day weekend, our room rate was $143/night, which was not bad for the location of the hotel (1.5 blocks from Millennium Park). The three stars is because of the bathroom. The bathtub drain didn't work! I had to unscrew the drain and started pulled out hair and a sponge clogging the drain. GROSS. I saw a bandaid in the drain too, but I didn't bother going any further. But worst of all, the maid knew the drain was clogged. When we returned to the room, I noticed the drain was unscrewed and left in the bathtub; we had left it screwed into the bathtub. So I thought, ""Oh good, the maid unclogged the drain."" WRONG. If it wasn't for the location and excellent service right outside the hotel, I would give this hotel two stars. The front door guys are very helpful with directions. They also recognized after our second trip to the hotel, and they always hit the open door button for us. That's service. The checkout process took 10 minutes, since video checkout wasn't working. The ""zip it"" line you call that states you cannot leave a message actually transfers you to someone instead of confirming automatically you're checked out (which is the impression I received).

An architectural masterpiece! This is my favorite big hotel in the country mainly because of the history, lobby, excellent service, and location. The hotel has three exits/entrances that give you access to three different streets so you are steps away from public transportation, the Berghoff, Millenium Park, and basically anywhere else downtown. The rooms are hit or miss. I have stayed in rooms that were updated and modern. I have also stayed in rooms that were old and dreary-looking. I will say that all of the rooms are very clean so that is always a major plus. The only reasons this hotel doesn't get a 5-star review are because they don't offer free wifi in the room (they charge $7.50 per HOUR to get access in your room), they charge $10 per day to use the fitness center even for hotel guests, and not all of the rooms are renovated. These are all major shortcomings of the hotel but I still love the Palmer House.

You can tell that the staff is proud of the hotel because every single staff member, I had the honor of meeting, was very friendly and eager to assist and the hotel is beautifully maintained. The lobby was exquisite...if you appreciated art the way I do, the art on the ceiling will have you walking straight while staring at the ceiling...needless to say, I bumped into a lot of people. Check-in was pretty smooth. Tyler took good care of us allowing us to check-in a few hours early and was happy to answer all of our crazy questions. Our room was on the Executive Floor. Key entry to ride the private elevator to heaven :) The elevator even had a bench for those people who are to lazy to stand lol. We arrive on the 23rd floor and excitement sets in. Let me tell you, Exective level is where its at! Snacks, soda, water available 24/7, Hot hor d'ourves available from 5-7pm, Complimentary contiental breakfast available every morning (not talking bagels and juice...Cold cuts, boiled eggs, plain yogurt, granola, breads, muffins, cereals, juices, coffee, hot oatmeal...sheesh What a spread!!), The room was very clean with a pleasant scent. The bed linens were plush which made it very difficult for me to leave each morning. Only gripe I had was it took me at least 5 minutes to at least turn on the shower each morning....I even had to call the maintence man one morning to demonstrate how to turn it on....he mumbled something about a German design...blah blah.

Normally my work pays for my trips, and did on this occasion, but I respect the folks out there reading this who may not be flushed with cash. This is a pricey hotel, and is probably a little bit more expensive than it needs to be. The building is old, and thusly, the rooms are not quite as spacious. However, my room did have an attached ""living"" room with chairs and another flat-screen tv, which helped stretch things out a bit. The lobby truly is spectacular. You come up from ground level by way of escalators and find yourself floored by the cathedral-esque painted ceiling and detailed architecture. Since the room was not ready by the time of check-in, the hotel offered $50 in hotel services for the wait. That $50 was used towards the amazing high tea they offer daily in the grand lobby - best high tea I've EVER had! Lots of food and you could also get a glass of champagne to boot. There was one gentleman with thick-rimmed glasses who would work the desk and he was just so helpful and delightful.

I thought that price was pretty good for early summer.  It's located right near the blue line (easy to get to after you arrive at the airport) and it's between most other loop lines (easy to get around the rest of the city).  The place touts itself for its history within the city and the performers it has hosted.  This is to say, good first impression. Upon checking in, we were offered an upgraded room with a king sized bed for $49 more.  We opted not to upgrade and they gave us an upgrade to a queen sized bed for free-- nice touch!  Our room was spacious, though it had one chair, a desk, and a TV stand along with the bed in the sleeping area leaving it looking empty.  The bathroom was on the smaller side, but it had some nice Peter Thomas Roth bath products.  However, the bathtub was majorly clogged.  Sad.   Outside of that, the room I had faced east, and the room filled with sunlight no matter how tightly I drew the blinds.  It made it hard to sleep past 7am.  As far as the rest of the hotel, the staff and front desk were friendly and helpful.  Checkout was easy, and we were able to leave our bags with the hotel for a couple hours before catching our train to the next destination.   So, the Palmer House was nice.  I wasn't blown away, but I was happy most of the time there.    In all my traveling experiences, I think it's worth staying if you can get it for under $150.",3,1,2,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The sheets were clean and cozy, the pillows aplenty & satisfactorily poofy. The room appeared recently redone in an art deco style. I can dig. No peeling wallpaper to complain about whatsoever, not even in the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is compact to the point that closing the door is awkward. Not so great for couples hot hotel seduction, but I was here for a conference. The raised sink as literal wash basin on counter was obnoxious. Also low. I'm tall, quit annoying me with sinks at my knees please. I did not find I was lacking for towel-hangage space, though yes the toilet is like a space rocket. So, too, are people next door if you happen to be so lucky. Very thin walls. Like, hearing people's entire conversations over HBO at midnight thin. All that is redeemed by the Food. The Palmer club is turkey, tomato, Gruyere [chorus of angels], bacon, and a black pepper mayo on multigrain bread. With truffle potato chips. The Sweet corn soup has chorizo, is light, tangy, carries a touch of heat. And, oh, yes, Bertha's brownie. I know not who she is, but I am proud of whoever created this dessert in her name. The brownie, with its fudge syrup and nuts, was good. Maybe not as good as the chocolate ice cream that accompanied it. Definitely not as awesome as the chocolate mousse. Omg. Also, eggs benedict.

Bathrooms: This one was fairly clean - a solid 8/10 but it loses major points for being the size of a brook closet. It was difficult to get in and out of to close the door, and there was no good place to put wet towels after our showers. I'm smaller than an average size woman, and I had some trouble maneuvering. The updates that were done to the bathroom did give it nice modern appeal. Toilets and shower were extremely noisy. The middle of the night bathroom trip could have woken the dead from their slumber! Room: Decent size room for the price. We were told we had a queen bed, but ti felt a little snug for a queen. The bed sunk in the middle a little bit (I would assume with a bed that size that typically only one person would sleep in it at a time). Linens were comfortable and enough pillows. Decor was nice and looked as if it had been recently updated. I liked the modern color scheme. The wallpaper on the walls was peeling in multiple places. Seems like such an easy fix that just wasn't done. Location: Just a few blocks away from Millennium Park and Grand Park, steps away from all color el stations and a block away from State Street shopping. I have no complaints with it! We actually walked almost everywhere the whole weekend because of the nice weather. Overall, the hotel itself was beautiful. I wished they would have cranked up the AC a little bit more in their common areas with the highs in the mid to upper 90s in Chicago. And their lobby is on the second floor which I found to be strange and somewhat frustrating as the signage wasn't terrific when we were checking after walking with bags on a warm day. Plenty of elevators (they are split in sections of rooms which was nice for a building that size - never waited more than 60 seconds). All common areas were neat and clean, the staff we did encounter was quite pleasant.

Stepping into the hotel was a little was odd as it was a cold, stale looking interior until we took the escalator up to the lobby where a ceiling mural of luxurious art greeted us; eat your heart out Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.  The lobby alone was rich in history and grandeur.  Check in was quick and friendly. There was just one elevator bank with eight cars, unless you were staying in the Executive floor and you had your own exclusive elevators to use.  Our room was located on the 8th floor, where the fitness center was located as well.  The room was of decent size and the decor although fairly newer, was kept in style of the hotel.  The bathroom was very small, but functional.  It could've used some ventilation system as it would get quite steamy during a hot shower so, we had to always prop the door open.  The room had a walk in closet and safe big enough to hold a laptop. However, our room did have a connecting door to each room on both sides of us.  One night, we could hear deafening cries from an infant in the room next to us.  I wanted to complain but I felt sorry for the parent who had to deal with it.  Then on the Friday night, we could hear music radiating  from the Ballroom (not sure how many floors below us) for a wedding or something.  But all things considered, noise wise, I would consider ourselves majorly lucky as we were placed in a room facing other rooms (Imagine a ""U"" shape, we were on one side of the ""U""), otherwise we would be hearing cars and the above ground train on Wabash. A couple other pros I should mention was the HSIA was complimentary, which is pretty rare for full service hotels, not to mention, the signal strength was excellent. The other pro was having a Starbucks on the ground floor. Overall, our stay was very pleasant and made our trip to Chicago totally enjoyable knowing we had a comfortable room and cozy bed in an amazing hotel!  Chicago was an awesome city and when we come back, we're staying at the PH again!",4,2,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com",1,1,0,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening.

I wrote the concierge and asked if I could upgrade. I was initially told that I would have to pay an extra $40 to upgrade. Unless of course I cancelled and re-booked. I had to write 3 emails to get a response to this. I would have paid for upgrades for all the rooms at $15, but that was not an option.

At check-in, I was lucky enough to be helped by an arrogant, entitled gentleman who didn't find it worthy of his time to share with me how I could find my room, where the pool was or even how to access the elevators. I couldn't even get the jerk to smile.  I didn't think much of it until I was checking out (more on that later) and heard another staff member graciously and cheerfully speak to patrons. Now, I have a lot of respect for housekeeping staff. They undoubtedly work very hard... but what I did not appreciate was 1) how late the rooms would be cleaned. I got back to my room at 4pm once and it was still in the state that I left it in 2) when I would leave my room in the mornings, how my housekeeper would ask me if I wanted my room cleaned. When I answered yes, she had to make sure I was certain of my decision and would then be disappointed. What the hell?! I get that it would be nice to have one less room to clean, but isn't that your job? 3) noisy and inconsiderate staff. Because the walls are paper thin at this hotel, I could hear EVERYTHING going on in the next room.... including the HUGE fuss the staff made about the room next door... at 7:30AM!!!!!!! Apparently, when my neighbors checked out of their room, they left behind quite a bit of broken glass and furniture. The staff cleaning up IN the room thought it appropriate to YELL OUT to other team members down the hall to come see the wreckage. I could distinctly hear the chatter, the furniture being moved around and even the noise coming from their walkie-talkies.... all at such an ungodly hour. Unforgivable. Plumbing was a nightmare. Not only was the flow from the shower head poor, but, if a housekeeper was cleaning next door and turned on the water there, my water pressure got even lower!!!! Did I mention that the bathroom is tiny?! Don't rock back and forth as you brush your teeth - you might just fall into the toilet! So here's my biggest gripe....an hour before check-out, I review my invoice and there's clearly an erroneous charge. I never dined in the hotel's restaurant. I try reaching the front desk SIX TIMES and no answer. I ask concierge to connect me and still no answer. Finally, 15 minutes later, I try again and get a live person on the phone. I explain that I never dined at the restaurant. No problem, he says, he'll remove the charge. Says I need to come down to pick up a new invoice.  I gather my belongings, head downstairs. A new staff member prints out my invoice and the charge is still there. I contest it and make reference to my call earlier. This dude says that there's nothing that can be done. In fact, because I didn't get the name of the person who said he'd waive it, I'm stuck. The charge needs to be ""investigated"". So hold on... I just spent over $900 staying at your hotel and you're gonna squabble with me for $17?!  Of course, I asked to speak to the manager. So Ms. Rasha comes out and says I should go home. If the charge isn't legit, she'll credit my account. I tell her that's not going to fly with me. This is my company card and each charge needs to be substantiated. I know I didn't dine at the restaurant in the hotel. IN FACT, I wasn't even at the hotel at 9:30pm last night. So she tells me, that 9:30pm must have been when the charge posted, I must have eaten there earlier and just simply forgot. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? I tell her no, I haven't dined at their restaurant PERIOD. She offers to go through last night's receipts and get this, if the name on the receipt matches mine, I have to pay for the dinner. Why would I try to get out of a $17 charge if I had actually authorized it?!  She says to come back after 30 minutes. I go back after 45 minutes, and a new staff member tells me she's still looking through receipts. Fine. I go make myself useful and come back 25 minutes later.  The new staff member goes into Rasha's office, comes out, and prints me a new invoice without the charge. No explanation. No apology. Nothing.  I asked her what happened and she says ""The manager removed the charge. It was posted to the wrong room.""   Does the manager not know anything about customer service? Does she not have the human decency to come out and tell me this in person after she had me wait over an hour?  I ask her to call out Rasha and the latter comes out with an indignant look on her face. I tell her that I'm appalled by her customer service and thank her for inconveniencing me. Her reply? ""You're welcome"".",1,4,1,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Look at this location!  Look at this building!  I want to die every time I go into the lobby it is so beautiful.   Ahh, but this is how they suck you in!  And how it just masks the greatly unfortunate experience from then on. Twice I had someone new at Registration.  And both times, instead of finding out the correct information, they tell me something completely different and wrong and completely waste my time. (1st time was in trying to get approval for me to check in without husband present, whose name was on the reservation.  2nd time I asked about a mailbox, because my letter was too large to fit in the mail chute on my floor. But to be fair, when I went to someone who knew what they were doing about my check in issues, it was fixed immediately.) So check in is at 3, right?  Exhausted,  I get to the room, throw down the bags, and call room service for a pot of coffee. Room service is ""closed"" until four. But the helpful pre-recorded message assures me that the restaurant downstairs, Lockwood, would definitely be able to help me!  I call Lockwood.  The chick on the phone says ""yep, come on down and get your coffee here"".  Oh, OK thanks, but I can just go to Starbucks for that?  Why would you have any service unavailable at the same time you have people checking in?   And speaking of the room.  I was ""upgraded"" because of the mix up at check in. My upgrade was to a small room that would have been beautifully decorated in 1990, complete with a large armoire that held a tube TV.  My view was of a fire escape (and most likely the alley below but I was too high up to see that far down.) Quite a bit different than the rooms they promote on the website.   I decide to check out the fitness center.  This is on a lower level, but when the elevator doors opened you would think you were in a completely different hotel.  Beautiful, modern decor in chocolate, greens and peacock blue.  The fitness center looks like a spa from the outside.  There is a woman at a desk who asks you to sign in.  Just as my pen hovered over the paper she adds ""Oh and by the way there is a $10 charge per day to use the facilities"".  Wait...what?  Are you serious?  Gah!  No thanks.   I just feel like my entire stay was non-stop irritation.  Are hotels the new airlines where the idea of service is dead and you are nickel and dimed to death?  I guess so, at least in the Palmer House.  Such a very serious let down.",2,6,2,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

06-Jan-12,Z5TMUHIT3-WZqCR-xAIEDA,EjRUFL0aoORBMfsmmkF3Qw,"Giving this hotel only two stars breaks my heart. I have a big old soft spot for the Palmer House, as it was the hotel I stayed in on my first trip to Chicago nearly 20 years ago. Back then I thought it was the most luxurious hotel in the world and will always remember that trip fondly. So I was excited to go back, and there were elements of my stay that lived up to my great memories. Fabulous location. Gorgeous lobby and common areas. Unfailingly polite and cheerful service from check-in to room service to housekeeping. Good-sized, relatively quiet room on a high floor. Nice lounge with tasty drink selections. Three big disappointments, though: 1. My room, albeit spacious, was tired and dated. I was surprised at how annoying it was to have an old tube TV stashed away in an inconvenient armoire instead of a flat screen on a more accessible bureau-top. 2. Hotel wireless was expensive and slow. I don't mind paying extra for premium wireless service, provided I actually GET premium wireless service. But I didn't see any real difference in what I got for my $19.99 at the Palmer House than I would for free at any Courtyard by Marriott. 3. But the real reason for the two-star review: My bathtub was a deathtrap. I am not kidding. The liner had separated from the tub frame and was all warped and spongy, so every morning it felt like I was taking a shower on a trampoline. It kept me so off balance I had to shampoo with one hand while clinging to the soap dish with the other. I could not imagine being an elderly person trying to navigate that dangerous enclosure. It's a wonder someone has not fallen, broken a hip, and sued them. My colleague, who has more Hilton points than I, stayed on one of the renovated floors and told me his room was really nice. He also snuck me into the concierge lounge, which was very comfortable and served up great wines and tasty hot and cold appetizers. So maybe the moral of the story is...stay at the Palmer House but on a concierge floor. That's a solution I could live with.",2,1,2,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

It was my first time negotiating on Priceline, and I believed it to be a great deal on a long Summer weekend that would get me out of Cedar Rapids.  The Palmer House proved to be a great experience, and not just because its a Hilton either. After doing some research I found there was certainly some history to the location, and I have to mention that they have done a decent job at preserving it. I was given a room clearly meant for one person, partly because I told them it was just me and also because I didn't mind not getting extra space. My first thought after entering the room was more a long the lines of ""This is the most perfect 1 bedroom you could find""! One could argue that another perspective would be- ""This is an extra store room""! Don't get me wrong, it was a small room that I greatly admired...clearly for one person. Other than that, the amenities and everything else was pretty good. You do notice the age of the property at times, but it does sell itself as a historic venue in Chicago. The lobby itself is quite a beautiful! The ceiling tapestry, the swanky bars, and the excellent decor makes it a place to be on any given night!

This hotel has it all and the overall rating of three and a half stars on Yelp is ridiculous. I have travelled the world and if this is not at least a four star hotel then I do not know what is. From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a ""grand"" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say ""Wow"" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing.

Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world.

I was here for a corporate event, and even the customers who came to visit during the day were complaining about the confusing layout of the hotel. Its ornate and beautiful, but that's about it. There are two places to eat at the hotel, that's it. One is closed during the day. So, one place to eat. ""Good luck getting breakfast"" the lady at the front counter joked no too long ago. She was actually very nice, and it was kind of funny, but... I was hungry and it's raining outside :P So now I'm at the corner street bakery. Kind of a shame, because there is so much history behind the hotel. Made as a gift for Palmer's wife in September 1871 it burnt down 13 days later in the great Chicago fire. Only to be rebuilt in plush opulent style and setting by 1873. It was the world's first fireproof hotel. It also boatsted telephone and electricity in every room, and something called an 'elevator'. They promoted it by saying it's a train between floors connected by pulley & rope. Palmer took out a $1.7 M loan, at the time to rebuild it, the largest loan for somethig like this. (I think that number is correct). In 1925 it was rebuilt again, this time going from 7 stories to 25 stories. At the time, the largest hotel in the world. In 1943 Conrad Hilton bought it for $20 million. And so, began it slow descent to wired wifi and big booty television sets. The Internet- you have to be plugged in to your room for the wifi to work!!! THAT'S NOT WIFI!!!! Or, you can get ""wifi"" in the hotel lobby, for $8/Hr. $20/night to be plugged in. And the cable is so short you kind of have to sit at the uncomfy desk, no laying in bed surfing the web action. I asked if I can check out an hour later. There is no one after me staying in the room, but, apparently it is hotel policy to Charge $50 if you check out at 1pm. This place is a joke. DO NOT STAY HERE. Instead, check out an air bnb, that's what I'm doing for the rest of my trip here :) Oh, also... This place is haunted... Heard multiple people say they heard whispers ;) PS: Paris Hilton sucks too.

I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel ""doesn't have a Customer Service department"" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk ""handles customer service."" She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, ""I am in the office all day but unable to take your call."" Is that even a thing?

The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces.

29-Sep-11,UT7tzqaxEhQG2Y8fHqisZg,BTIu4M6Jb-284Yupnj0vBw,"The only thing I liked about this hotel was the lobby. I went to Chicago for a cousin's wedding and we decided to stay at the palmer house because it is such a historic place. When we first got there we stood in a long line to check in and when I finally got to the receptionist he was not very friendly and freaked out when the reservation was under my moms name and not mine and made my mom come down out of her room to confirm I was telling the truth. Anyway when we got to our room it was rather small. No coffee pot, no fridge, a large old box TV. The room was clean but nothing special. When I was getting ready for the wedding I needed to blow dry my hair and the blow dryer in our room didn't blow hot air so I had to go to my moms room to get a blow dryer. This gets me to my next point: THE ELEVATORS SUCK! Well first off all they put me on the 12th floor and my mom and her husband on the 18th floor. Not necessarily a big deal but the elevators at the palmer house are in three different groups and go to three different groups of floors. What I mean is in the lobby I had to get in the elevators for floors 10-15 and my mom got in elevators for floors 16-20 or something like that. So every time I needed to go to my moms room or vice versa I had to go all the way down to the lobby and then catch the other set of elevators to her floor. HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS! Also because we were there for a wedding, I was supposed to receive a gift bag with snacks and info about the wedding. Well I never got mine and I spent 20 minutes running all over the hotel looking for it with no success. Also at the Palmer house if you need to use a computer or the internet you have to pay a big price. Anyway my mom had to do a reading in the wedding and she lost the piece of paper so I went down to concierge and there were about three of them standing around doing nothing and I asked if they could print this off for me really quick because it was an emergency. They rudely told me to go to the business center and print it off myself. Anyway the service in the lobby SUCKED. However I will say that the cleaning staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Usually when I stay in a hotel just one night I don't need the staff to clean my room so I put the DND sign out. Well we were leaving to go see the sights one morning and the cleaning lady was right there and said oh I was about to clean your room and we said it was fine and then she suggested to give us at least a set of clean towels. VERY NICE CONSIDERATE CLEANING STAFF. Also avoid the restaurant they have in the lobby. The Lockwood I think. Horrible experience. See my next review. But I probably won't be staying at the Palmer House Again. There are many much nicer hotels in Chicago that offer fantastic customer service.

When I got to the hotel they couldn't find my extra day, which was cool because they eventually found it. I was told it would be corrected in the system and put as one reservations rather than two.. Great... that is until I tried to get into my room at like 1am and my key wasn't working! Apparently the woman forgot to fix the error in the system & I was checked out. That was fixed and they checked me back in after about 30 minutes. Next they didn't clean my room the day of the ""check-out situation""... I don't know if it is because no one was supposed to be in the room, but I think that it's disgusting. I was annoyed to enter my room and see my bed still unmade and no new clean towels and wash cloths. Lastly, I was supposed to receive a non-smoking room and received a smoking room.

More furniture than would fit in my bedroom. But I digress. I've seen single rooms with king sized beds that were larger than this, and the double rooms are quite a bit larger.

If the hotel were a person, it'd be old-money.  (Like the cranky great-aunt you hope to inherit from.)  But like old-money, there's some rust around the edges.  The lobby is amazingly gorgeous.  No hands down.  The guest rooms... kinda small and shabby, for a Hilton.  The closet and bathroom were tiny.  There was only about a foot of clearance betwixt door and dunny in the loo, and that doesn't really work.  There was only about 6"" of vanity space on either side of the sink.  I'm sure this was standard when the place was built, and it's modern standards that have changed.  But still.  It's a bit cramped, and it was just me in the room. Realistically, it's an older building, and a skyscraper at that, which is going to entail lots of structural support to work around.  Revamping the guest rooms would probably entail knocking down walls and re-doing entire floors, which would be disruptive to other guests, a loss of revenue, and there'd be fewer rooms available in the end.  (I think.  I'm a CPA, not an architect, but to my amateur eyes, it does not look like it'd be an easy remodel.)  Sorry.  HGTV moment.  Where was I?   Also like old money, this place can be cheap in irritating ways.  $15 (or more) for internet in your room, and wired at that, so no surfing while sitting in bed.  $7 for an hour for internet in the lobby.  WTF?  On the one hand, if I lived in Chicago, and the lobby had free internet, I'd be inclined to take up space there quite often.  On the other hand, $7 for an hour of internet in the lobby??   I've never been somewhere where internet in the lobby came at a price.   (There was too much stone for my T-Mobile smart phone to get any signal.  Which meant I missed a couple calls.  Grr.) Thanks to Yelp I was forewarned about early check-in fees and late check-out fees.  I was honestly surprised that storing my luggage didn't come with a fee.   I didn't interact much with the staff, but they seemed very professional, especially at the front desk.  (I'd put my hotel room keycard behind the magnet closure in my purse, so I had to get it re-programmed at 1:00am.  They asked for ID, which is reassuring, for safety reasons.) I'm glad I came here, at least once.  The public areas are beautiful, and I like pretty architecture.  I probably wouldn't seek it out again as a place to stay, though.  I would, however, definitely be willing to meet people in the lobby for cocktails.  As long as we didn't expect to use our cell phones to find each other.",3,3,3,5,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

You're leaving your home to sleep and eat somewhere else. You should feel like you're staying in a second home. My family and I took a family vacation to Chicago to bury my Grandma's ashes and do some sightseeing while we were there. My Mom booked this hotel from Priceline so I was skerred all the way there. I'd never seen the PH so I was skeptical at best. They were doing some work on the front of the hotel and it was a mess but they were very careful not to inconvenience the guests which was much appreciated. Nothing is worse than fearing for your life by entering a door. (It came out beautiful by the way). When we arrived, we were given a key to my Mom & sisters room and another key to mine and my brother's room. My room was SO small and on a different floor than my Mom's room so I asked if they could move us. Good thing! We got a room that was twice as big and had a better view. You could have put another 4 beds in that room and it wasn't considered a suite. Sweet for us! The lobby is amazing and gives you that feeling of old-world Chicago. It was like getting in a time machine but not in a bad way. Everything was well maintained and all the employees made us feel like they were honored we were there. We even got a nice note from the front desk worker a few hours after we checked in. The hotel bar is a little pricey and stuffy so we opted for the dive bar next door with all the pictures on the wall. Help me out with the name here people, I loved that place. It was literally next door from the entrance that faces the El. I was worried about the location of this place but we managed to walk everywhere we needed to go. It was really nice having Corner Bakery on the corner too, they have great breakfasts. Didn't try the breakfast in the hotel because we were usually in a hurry to go on an adventure. I guess the only reason why I can't give them 5*s is because I'm still and always be a hotel snob. You're going to have to ramp it up to mimic the Four Seasons or Ritz for me to max it out. I did love this place though, I'd recommend it for people staying in Chicago & not wanting to spend a billion dollars on a place to stay.",4,3,3,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw
21-Oct-09,jed,YT-tCQkmqqPJKQeCFGegFQ,"I lived in Chicago for a few years between high school and college (sometime shortly after Gutenberg had printed his first Bible).  I was too young and too poor to enjoy many of the places I would have liked, so when I registered for a huge scientific meeting in Chicago I chose The Palmer House as my hotel. When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy.  One of the younger members of the group said ""That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick"" to which someone added ""When the hell was Rick ever elegant?"". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet.  I have a 3G wireless widget  for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection.  A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level.  All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.",3,4,3,3,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I agree that the rooms are small - but really, how much room do you actually need to sleep? - There is so much going on right outside the hotel that I find it hard to see why people would want to spend the entirety of their stay indoors. And if they did, the beds in the newly renovated rooms are plush and the shades completely darken the place.   One thing that bugged me was the lack of cell phone reception throughout much of the hotel.  I could hardly get a signal - which either says something about Sprint or something about the bunker-like construction methods used in the 1800s.   Regardless, the rates we paid (via Priceline) were super cheap, about $80 before taxes and fees.  So, I can deal with a small room and having to call for more towels or pillows.  One thing that bugged me was the parking, it was super expensive (about $30 - and that was the special deal).  Anyway, you don't really need a car here because you are steps from the El and a lot of other points of interest are right outside your door. Bottom line: if you get a good price, go for it.",4,3,3,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I was absolutely in love with it! Drinks: *Berthas mulled wine (red wine, orange and lemon zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, star anise, cloves, vanilla bean, brown sugar, honey): I absolutely loveeeeeeeddddddd this drink. It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go. My boyfriend drank like half of it because he also liked it so much. *Winter dream (absolut vanilla, st german, baileys, whipped cream, cinnamon): this drink was also good if you are a Baileys lover. I wish I had more of a Baileys hint to it though. It is sometimes hard to find seats here and my only complaint would be that I hate it when kids are taking up half the seats. For goodness sakes, it's a bar area and they don't drink, why the hell are they there?

02-Oct-09,9T9jysrm5fqsoKda5iffjw,jHmlmozty9ifc9qjkuHsoA,"Despite the fact that the lobby is quite nice, my room is huge, and I got a reasonably priced air/hotel package, I just can't give this hotel more than 2 stars. I'm writing this review from my hotel room, and am paying $14.95 a day for the internet connection. I guess that's not so unusual, and at least there are three differently priced connection options based on speed (I went for the cheapest). But I just feel nickel-and-dimed! It really started with the $25 extra fee for early check-in (about noon). I've never heard of that before. Kind of ticked me off right when I got here. I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge room. But was very surprised to find a teeny tiny bathroom, especially given the size of the room. The bathroom is so small, that even though I am the only person in my huge hotel room, I can barely get into the bathroom and have to squeeze around the door, then shut the door to have room to stand at the sink, or anything else. But first I have to get the light to turn on, so it is not pitch black when I close the bathroom door. This is a major production since it is kind of stuck in the ""off"" position. To add insult to injury, although there is a magnifying mirror attached to the wall (the kind you can use to put on makeup extra-carefully), it's attached at a height designed for someone about 6 feet tall! Since I'm 4'11"", I can't actually see myself in the mirror. It just taunts me by being there. On to the actual room. Clean. Comfortable. Wait, why am I only giving this hotel 2 stars? Well, there is no coffee maker! I can't remember the last time I stayed in a hotel where there wasn't a small coffee set in the room. I guess they want me to buy the starbucks in the lobby instead. But I was kind of counting on the coffee set to heat hot water, so I could make my Trader Joe's instant oatmeal packet in the morning for breakfast. Hmmm. I guess they'd rather I bought the hotel oatmeal for $5 a bowl. And I also guess I could ask for a coffee set to be brought to my room. Would only cost $8. *sigh* Well, at least I brought workout clothes for the 4 days I'm staying here. At $18 per day (or $45 per 3 days), it's a bit pricey just to be able to work out for a few days, but at least I'll be able to use the spa amenities too, right?. Well, luckily I checked out the fitness center before paying, because I just don't like it. Most folks would probably like it fine, but the elliptical machines (only thing I use) here are *again* made for someone 6 feet tall, not someone my size. And the spa amenities aren't all that appealing. And since there are no 24 hr fitness locations nearby (I'm a member), I guess I brought my workout clothes for no good reason other than to use up the space in my luggage. Okay, this review is getting kind of long, and a bit too whiney. So for my last issue with this hotel - I tried calling the ""guest service hotline"" several different times since I've been here to ask some questions, but I don't think they actually staff the ""hotline"". On four different attempts, I only once reached an actual person, and I let it ring about 20 times each attempt before giving up. Last night all I wanted to know was where I could get some ice. When they finally directed me to the room with an icemaker (near the elevator), it was a room with peeling paint, cracks on the wall, and a flickering lightbulb. Yech. Tonight I wanted to ask some questions about getting back to the airport. I guess I'll just have to figure it out myself.",2,9,2,2,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

When you walked into the room, instantly, I knew why the room was so inexpensive.  They gave us a queen size bed after informing us that they were all out of king sizes (we had a late check-in).  The bed seemed to take up the entire room.  When I looked out  the window, my ""view"" consisted of brick walls and the windows of other rooms.  I now realized why other rooms had their curtains drawn. The bathroom was fairly large, however, we couldn't get the stopper to stay up and keep the bathtub from filling with water, not to mention the fact that the the bathroom had no ventilation of any kind, which makes for a pretty stinky deal, if you catch my drift (pun intended). All in all, the room served its purpose: Sleeping, showering and changing for a very short stint in Chicago.  If I were on ""vacation"", I would have definitely opted to upgrade to a suite for a more comfortable stay.   The pros of the hotel: Nice bar, lobby/lounge area, Starbucks is conveniently located downstars.  It was conveniently central to everything: Millennium Park, Grant Park, a few blocks walking distance from Magnificent Mile. However, the best part about this hotel: It had a UPS connected to one of its South entrances, which was open on Sunday!  I ended up getting stamps and sending postcards to family, as well as mailed a t-shirt I had purchased for my niece.  That UPS was the saving grace of my trip.  Had it not been open, I'm sure the t-shirt would still be sitting in the corner of my room, a miserable heap, begging to be shipped to a pretty princess in San Diego.",3,0,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down.

Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.",4,3,1,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn.

I do know a few things though. Enter the Palmer House Hilton: location is decent. If I were a guest staying downtown and wanted to experience the city, I probably wouldn't choose this location unless you want to be closer to Millenium Park. Walking into the hotel, it's gorgeous. It's massive size reminds me of hotels in Vegas that go on for miles. In fact, I believe that the lobby with all of the bars, etc. also reminds me of a Vegas hotel (without the casino of course). I wanted to get there early to have a cocktail prior to leaving for my party, but ended up falling behind. Never EVER wait until after 5 to check into the hotel on NYE. The line was nuts. Lucky guests waited in line while others in their party got them drinks from the bar. I knew I should have brought another person with me. Oh well. On the website, I was notified if you are staying on the Executive Level, there is a quick credit card check-in option to avoid long lines. This was not the case when I got there and the lady at the front desk never heard of that. Interesting. Perhaps something for them to look into during crowded periods? Though, for my long wait, the front desk lady gave me late check out at 2pm for free. I chose executive level because 1) it sounded cool 2) I figured it would be quieter with more business people (or just less children). Little did I know it also comes with breakfast and appetizers from 5-7 on a special floor. Fun stuff. The room was NICE. It was large and came with a couch, tv, desk, nice bed, and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy. Or it felt that way after my NYE partying. And it's not squeaky and has plenty of pillows. I just hope they wash their sheets. Vending machines. All I wanted in the morning was a bottled water, but did not have enough 1s. So I thought since it was $2.50, I could buy two and use a $5. Well, I found out it only takes 1s. Not cool. I don't like to use the glasses in the rooms due to shows about how they are never washed. I was forced to use one. :( I didn't end up using my late checkout since I got about 3 hours of sleep (it was New Years!) . I checked out on my phone to avoid lines and grabbed some ""breakfast"" in the lounge upstairs right before it closed. It was pretty much picked through, but I got a sesame bagel and chive and onion cream cheese. Definitely needed something in my stomach. All in all, I really enjoyed staying on the Executive Level. I did feel cool. We had separate elevators where you have to insert your key to get in. And the elevator was right by the front desk. I'm not sure where the other elevators were located, but that was pretty convenient. The hotel definitely served its purpose and I would stay here again if I'm in the area.",4,1,1,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I understand it's a historic hotel, however I was in room 21-167 and beside the room being the smallest hotel room I've ever been in I don't think it was maintained very well. The carpet is worn and and needs replacing (felt the same about the hall and elevator landing) There was black hair on the shower walls, mildew on the shower grout, trash BEHIND the trash can in the bathroom, and it looked like the bath amenities had been used and not replaced. The woman who checked me was was in training according to the badge she was wearing but it took her forever to check me in, she didn't say more than 2 words to me so it was mostly awkward silence. The remote in my room didn't work and when engineering came up with a 2nd one that didn't work. I was told that they were in the middle of a shift change so someone else would have to come up and it took almost 30 mins, that guy brought a remote & did something to the TV before telling me it was fixed (I was working at the desk). However, when I went to turn the TV off the 3rd remote wasn't working either. Because I arrived at 1:30pm, left at 4pm, returned at midnight and went straight to bed, got up at 6 am and left at 6:30 for a flight I didn't say anything to the hotel, it just wasn't worth the hassle of moving. However, if I had been there any longer I would have complained to the front desk. No wireless Internet in the guest rooms. They get 3 stars because: Convenient location, the doorman who got me the cab to get to the airport was very friendly, and the 3rd star out of hope that I just had an off experience.

Are there this many people checking in right now? Actually, their computers were down, so check ins were being done...I actually have no idea how they were doing them, but it took a while.  As we stand in line, hotel staff are walking around handing out glasses of sparkling wine.  Okay, I can live with this.....two glasses later, we are checking in.  When the man at the front desk sees my reservation, he mysteriously disappears to the back for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  Upon his return he says he upgraded our room to a queen bed.....from a twin??? WTF! Why would you have a twin bed in a hotel? At least that's what both my boyfriend and I heard, but we were too stunned to ask more questions.  We were also given a cute little gift bag that we later realized was not from the hotel, but from the wedding party   So our grand upgrade was a small room with not much of a view and a tiny, but beautiful bathroom.  Since we were not planning on spending much time in the hotel, this was perfect.  We needed a place to sleep and get dressed.  We were walking everywhere, so we didn't need the gym and we were not driving, so valet and parking wasn't a concern. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Millennium and Grant Park, the Art Institute of Chicago, Navy Pier, Wendella Boat Tours, and a ton of shopping and food options.  The wedding events were less than two miles away, so it was a pleasant walk when we wanted to or a short and inexpensive cab ride when we didn't want to walk.   We had the brunch buffet at the hotel restaurant, Lockwood, one morning.  The food was good, but it was way overpriced.  Although, I'm a sucker for lox and bagel fixings every time, so I was happy.  Overall we had a great experience.  The convenience of everything close by, made our stay here worthwhile.",4,1,0,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I didn't realize we were right next to the train tracks, but the sounds didn't really bother us. We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said ""wait at CVS and you'll see someone there."" No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon..

She had a severe allergic reaction and had to be carried out by paramedics, spending time in the hospital. The hotel could've done a better job not only apologizing, but also honoring her request. Another small error was made in that a few random people wandered into the Empire Room. This isn't a huge deal, but from a security standpoint, it should be treated as one. A Keith Urban lookalike, who was obviously not a guest at a sorority formal (I can understand older dates, but he looked at least 35...), entered the room when I was outside with my friend.

It is clearly a hub of events from weddings to meetings with the corporate meeting rooms and the 1000+ rooms to accommodate everyone. However, in the realm of hotels I have experienced as a pleasure and business traveler, I have to admit Palmer House gets an ""eh"" when it comes to the room. My room was a double (to be shared with my sister and mom) while we were attending my cousin's wedding this past weekend. The room itself was spacious and had 2 full (but super super small with no ventilation) bathrooms which were awesome and a blessing in disguise when you have 3 women getting ready in the mornings. But that's pretty much it. The TV was super old school, and sits on one of those old hutches  that are awkward to get around and was about 24 inches max. No coffee maker or mini fridge, thereby forcing you to go to their restaurant  for coffee or waters (although there is an in house Starbucks on the lowest level which is only open until about 8 I think). The restaurant and bar also close super early so we were forced to look elsewhere at 12 am on a Saturday night for late night food and drinks. It is not a hotel I would return to to relax in tranquility as I could hear my neighbors above and next door talk loudly at ALL hours. I give it 1 star for the area in which is sits--super close to State street which has shopping which came in handy on a sweltering 90 degree day, as well as being close to Millennium Park and some good food. A couple of train lines and taxis abound. 3 stars for the AMAZING security team who helped my mom get around by bringing the wheelchair in a timely fashion multiple times a day when requested. Seriously, I don't know how I would have done it without them! Its a big hotel and really hard to get around if you are disabled and need help. Minus 1 star for the quality of the room overall and the lack of some amenities I would expect from a metropolitan hotel. I think if you are looking for a place to crash in while enjoying everything the city of Chicago has to offer, the Palmer will suffice. But if you are looking for something more relaxing and luxurious I would say you may have better luck somewhere else with more modern and updated  amenities.",3,0,0,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The staff are friendly and helpful, and the bartenders are more than willing to get a little creative if need be. Unfortunately the luxury aesthetics of the hotel are reflected by its price tag, the rooms start at $200 a night and go up, the food in the restaurant is top-notch but also top-tier, same for the bar and other amenities such as $18/stay internet. Unfortunately there is also no wireless within the rooms and cell phone signal is non-existant within most of the building, both of these are probably factored in by the fact that the building has quite a bit of marble in the interior which will block both of these signals. Staying in downtown chicago I thought there would be a good variety of selection for food, however outside of a pizza place one block away, and a hot dog place 5 blocks away everything consisted of the same recurrent chains every block - you will see at least one of these every 2 blocks: subway, mcdonalds, 7/11, cvs, starbucks - outside of that and the two independently run places i mentioned earlier the closest thing is a trip to the greek section which is about 2 miles away.",3,0,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Dismayed with the check in process I made my way to my room which only increased my frustration with the hotel. The room was small, very small.

The toilet was the centerpiece of the room and from there you could adjust the water in the shower or do your hair in the mirror. Okay, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. The only redeeming quality about this room was that the bed was comfortable and clean. Of note - the hotel did not offer wireless internet, the elevators were very slow, and none of the staff seemed overly friendly or engaged. Furthermore, while dining at their main restaurant, I had to wait nearly an hour to get a check after our server went missing. In summary, this will be my first and my last stay at the hotel.

One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a ""cork fee"" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF???

Very small.  But, okay, the Palmer House has been there since, when?  the late 1800's?  So I'll excuse the size of the room.  Decorating? Gauche. And NO FAN in the BATHROOM!  Imagine three women trying to shower, change, do hair in a postage stamp room when there's no fan in the bathroom.  All of the mirrors were fogged over.  NOT good.   After the event, I was ready for a great night's sleep. It was around 12:30 when I crawled into bed. At 1:45, someone started banging on the door across the hall, and yelling for ""LaShonda"" to wake up.  this went on for about three minutes, and, just as I was about to call security, LaShonda got out of bed, opened the door, explained that she was drunk and had puked all over the place, and let the door banger in.  I fell asleep again at about 2:30.  At 4AM, the guy in the room next to me decided it was time to call Mike and see if they could ""get some women.""  Bill, the other guy in Mike's friend's room, kept saying, ""It's 4 o'clock in the morning."" But Mike's friend, apparently had a deep need for a woman.  I didn't know whether to call the front desk or yell through the wall the suggestion that Mike's friend and Bill go across the hall and get LaShonda.  After about ten minutes, I heard the door bang and Bill and Mike's friend headed out onto the mean streets of Chicago to look for women.  Then, at about 7, the families started trundling down the hall with their wheeled suitcases and squeaky-voiced children.  This eventful night at the Palmer House set my company back $321.  Maybe they have extremely nice suites available for more than that, with sound proofing that really keeps you from hearing about LaShonda's puking or Mike's friend's need for women, but I would not go back.

04-Oct-10,1BD,2uZEpLX3znS3WuIXMWWp6Q,"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.",4,1,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again).  The bathroom was ok, small but ok.     I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings.     I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning. At 8am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door. Mind you the bed is close to the door. I felt like I was being punked. I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door.

We signed our contract with Mark Coy, a sales & catering coordinator at the Palmer House.  While he was pleasant in our meetings and would explain what we would need to do, I never really felt confident in his ability to make our day special.  I always needed to initiate questions to get answers and every meeting felt rushed because he had to be out the door by 6pm.  He always said ""no problem"" to everything but then there was a huge problem that finally had me in a  bridezilla moment.  In our initial room block we asked Mark to substitute two regular rooms for two suites.  Well, he put five suites on our block.  I had numerous phone calls from my guests that our block was full.  I didn't know until after the fact that each suite was taking 2 regular rooms out of our block.  In our meetings we always discussed increasing the number of rooms on our block as well.  Of course, he said ""no problem"" based on availability.  Well, a good coordinator would have told his client that the weekend of their wedding was also the largest convention in the city of Chicago.  So when we needed the additional rooms we heard ""sorry we're booked"".  Never once did he put the fear in our mind that we wouldn't have rooms for our guests.  At that moment I definitely knew that I could not work with someone who obviously could care less about our wedding.  We also had issues with charging of rooms as well.  I think that the rooms manager/department definitely needs some work in this location.  Our parents were charged the suite rate of $329, when they were supposed to be charged $289.  My mother-in-law was paying for her sister's room, but then they charged her sister's credit card.  Being an upscale hotel these issues shouldn't happen. I immediately asked for Jane Himmel to replace our coordinator as I heard she was the best coordinator there.  She is AMAZING and was our wedding angel.  We had set up a meeting for the next week as this was a Friday.  We were actually meeting with our florist on that evening at 6:30pm and she came to this meeting to meet us & go over a few details.  I was astonished that she would meet us on a Friday evening and she stayed until the end which concluded at 9:30pm.  She had to pretty much start from scratch and had two months to put it together.  The next day (Saturday) she emailed us a rough draft of our timeline & had forwarded some spreadsheets to fill out for her which included our parents info & our other vendors.  (The only thing Mark ever emailed me was a sample timeline of an early evening wedding and I am assuming I was to put it together)  She made us feel like she was going to make our wedding special and not just another cookie cutter wedding that our other coordinator was going to put together.  She could tell I was feeling stressed from everything going on and she suggested Claudia Antony, a day of coordinator.  Now, I was feeling great and actually enjoying the final months of wedding planning.         Jane got us back on track with our reception and did more in two weeks than our first coordinator did in almost 10 months.  We are so appreciative for the amount of time and effort on her part to make all of the details of our wedding reception seamlessly play through the night.  She was patient, organized, professional and easily accessible.  She stayed through the majority of our wedding and was relentless in her effort to make us happy.  We couldn't think of favors and she provided us an idea for what we should do.  She guided us through our meal choices, wine choices (as we were not happy with the others offered to us) and came up with a cake option that was magnificent.  She surprised us at our reception with keys to the penthouse for our two day stay, our wedding night & the night after.  She ""WOWED"" us time after time.  Her job didn't end there as the next day we set up a brunch for 60 people.  She had everything set up beautifully in the Honore Ballroom for the conclusion of our wedding weekend.  Let's just say Jane went above & beyond in all matters pertaining to our wedding.  I am sure there are so many more details that Jane attended to that I couldn't even begin to think about.  I couldn't imagine a more beautiful start to our new life together! Thank you Jane!",5,3,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The only plus was that it was two blocks from the office from which I was working when I was traveling to Chicago. This hotel is so massive that one could lose ones way in its cramped and labyrinthine halls that span across three wings. The bathrooms were claustrophobic, the TVs had poor reception and the room service food was less than mediocre, thanks to the average 1-1.5 hour delivery time, I'm sure. Oh, and the air conditioning was so affective that I had to wear a sweatshirt in my room in the middle of the summer. They seem to cater well to their conventions and conferences than individual guests, probably because these conferences/conventions bring in a lot of money, but it is not a legitimate justification for the lack of appropriate attention towards the rest of their clientele. It is the hospitality industry after all, one has to have some basic standards and principles, which this hotel certainly lacks. STAY AWAY if you can help it.",1,4,2,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

Apparently, it's the oldest standing hotel in North America, and every president since Ulysses S Grant has taken rest there. With help from my friend William Shatner (the Priceline Negotiator dontchaknow) I was able to bag a $250 hotel room for $75 a night, and subsequently upgraded (at an $18 a night charge) to a suite with two bathrooms, because we needed two beds as well. I can't vouch for the restaurant (since I am obviously a cheapskate), but the pool and hot tub were great, and never packed since they were tucked away on the 7th floor. And what other hotel is going to have an entire room for elevators? I would recommend this place if you're able to score a comparable deal, both because of the history and location (zoom into downtown Chicago and you'll find this at its epicenter), but couldn't in good conscience tell you to drop the retail price on a place where you're more or less paying for the legacy.",4,2,1,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

It's the real deal.  The current version of the Palmer House opened in 1925 but it's origins date back to 1871.  Even if you don't stay here, stop by and have a martini at the lobby bar.  Soak up the atmosphere around you.  Think of all the history that has passed though this lobby and the people that have had a drink at this bar.  The roaring 20's, Black Friday 1929, WW II, heck it is even quite possible that Al Capone and his henchmen had a drink at this bar.  The rooms are small by modern standards and the bathrooms are very small.  Remember this hotel was built in 1925, and at that time these were large rooms.  The water pressure in the shower was very low but again this is a historic hotel and we were on the top floor.  As with most Hilton properties the bed is very comfortable.  Down pillows and comforters are always a hit in my book.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  I feel that the bellmen and doormen outshined the rest of the staff I came in contact with.  They were sincerely friendly, funny and helpful.  During our departure, our bellman ran out into traffic on State Street to hail us a taxi.  It almost looked like a cop commandeering a car during a police chase.  I would most definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone doing the tourist thing in Chicago, especially if you are a history buff.",4,0,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I called the Palmer House's catering office and spoke with Jane Himmel, the Senior Catering Manager.  I inquired as to the availability of the Empire Room for our exact anniversary date, June 23rd - a Thursday.  Opportunity struck when I was told the room was not being used for a previously scheduled event that night. I suggested my idea to Jane that my wife and I have dinner for 2 in the Empire Room on the night of our anniversary, just as we celebrated our wedding there 10 years ago to the hour.  This is when Jane and her team took over. To my surprise and excitement, Jane took this idea from the start and worked very hard to make this idea, this dream, become a reality.  I worked with Jane over the next couple of weeks and days leading up to our night.  She helped me pull off one of the greatest nights and best memories my wife and I will ever share.

21-Aug-10,s1zWtLtuI9MtI,Y1T7sd4TKOe4utqV5hFdMQ,"This review is for Potters, the bar/lounge at Palmer. On balance this place is not bad, however; the service has been inconsistent on the last couple of visits. I came here with a friend on Saturday a couple months ago and found the place to be a perfect sanctuary: dark with plentiful bar snacks, non-hovering service, and an inventive cocktail menu. On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come. That day, the space also seemed to be filled with several young kids (think 9-13 year olds) as part of a family or other traveling group. Now, I am not anti-kid by any means, but these ankle-biters and their parents apparently didn't get the memo that children are to be seen and not heard.",2,1,1,1,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

When I arrived, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and I felt like I was not treated any differently just because I had booked through priceline. I requested and was able to get a queen-size bed and a room away from the El. While the view from the room left a little to be desired (my view was of other hotel rooms about 100 feet across from mine), I didn't hear any street noise or the train. However, I did notice that the walls were pretty thin. I could hear people having phone conversations next door as well as hallway noise. The room was a little on the small side, but clean and well-designed. The location is excellent. It's two blocks away from Michigan Ave and the Art Institute. Three blocks away from Millenium Park. Entrances to the Red Line are one block away. I won't comment much on the lobby, because that has been commented a lot here...needless to say, it's pretty impressive. As with most pricey hotels, they nickel and dime you here. Internet is $20/day and I believe there is a charge to use the gym facilities.

I'm a big fan of anything with a great history behind it, and this hotel is chalk full of interesting history. I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there.

This time the issue was the hotel: Plus 1 star: location Plus 1 star: gorgeous lobby, historical hotel Minus 1 star- for PAPER THIN WALLS Minus 1 star- for being woken by maid each morning Minus 1 star for not only not allowing my boyfriend in the room when his card stopped working & not being helpful to him in any way. I have travelled throughout the US, Europe & Asia and I don't remember any hotel, motel, or any other lodging where the maids come before checkout or at least 11am.  This might not have been that problemmatic but the paperthin walls did not help. FRI:    9:23am Maid service next door (to those that flew in late & are on CA time that felt like 7:23am about 5 hours BEFORE I had planned to wake).   We're not talking about faintly hearing the vaccuum, we're talking hearing her push all the hangers in the closet together ... that's how thin the walls were. I crawled out of bed & put a ""do not disturb"" sign up.  A few minutes later our door starts shaking and this weird noise like someone's rubbing against the door Apparently they polish them every morning  -- I'd have to say she didn't read the sign about NOT DISTURBING US. Later that night got to listen to our neighbors have sex. SAT:  Maid service comes through at 8:30am!

Went out to visit a friend about an hour outside of Chicago.  Get a call from my BF.  His card won't work on the room. He went to the front desk & since his name wasn't on the reservation they wouldn't give him a new card (Fair enough, appreciate their not giving one to just anyone). What really pissed me off was they refused to consider any reasonable alternative to prove his claim or assist him. I mean he did have a hotel card, he knew the name of the person in the room, he knew the room #, he could describe the room & our luggage, offered to give them the credit card # the room was charged too - he wasn't just coming in randomly & fishing for info. They told him having me call & verify him would NOT be enough to let him in. He then asked them to look at the key and see if they could see why it didn't work.  Theyclaimed the key was fine and if it was valid it should work (accusing him of not only having found a key but mysteriously knowing the room # & name associated with the card)?.  They also refused to send someone up with him so he could prove the card didn't work and that his belongings were really in the room. So he called me upset that he wasn't allowed in our room, he was exhausted from a long day and I was not expected back for at least 4 hours and was at least an hour away. I called and demanded to speak to someone who would attempt to assist him and got someone to add his name to the reservation and they let him in - but it definitely soured our afternoon. Other things that I would not have bothering mentioning except that I was so sleep deprived & cranky about the above instances : The front of the building is under construction (which is a shame, would've liked to see it).  It would have been nice if they told me this on the phone when I called for the address, they gave me the street that had no entrance, instead of the street that had a working entrance). And I suppose it was my fault for asking for closest subway line when coming from the airport (not knowing there were separate train/non-train lines), so instead of giving us the stop 15 feet in front of the front door that was exactly on our line from the airport - I was told to get out at a stop about 5 blocks away... still, deductive reasoning should have told her that confused tourist from out of town coming from Midway on the Orange line, probably wants the closest Orange line stop, not to spend more time transferring to some other line for a further stop & then toting luggage to the hotel.",2,0,0,0,N,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The lobby is beautiful & luxurious and I couldn't wait to check-in and relax in our room. And here's where it all went downhill. The front desk clerk was a little on the snippy side. We were given our keys and sent on our way only to find that she had given us a room with ONE double bed which is not what we had reserved.  You would think the front desk clerk would have thought something was amiss when she checked us in.  My husband was standing right there and at 6'6 would barely fit in that bed by himself, let alone the both of us.  I immediately called down only to be placed on hold for an eternity so the manager could be consulted.  The manager never even bothered to speak to us to apologize and had the clerk handle it. I had to tell them that I had the printed documentation/receipts that proved we were guaranteed more than that. At this point, the only room available was a handicapped room with 2 double beds. At least one of us wouldn't have to sleep on the floor. By the way, the first room we were given was quite shabby and on par with a ""Days Inn"" level. The wallpaper was peeling. The furniture looked old & worn. The second room looked like it was more recently updated but still lacked the oomph that nice hotels should have.  It was a failed attempt at replicating the look of Kimpton Hotel properties.  The TV was extremely dated.  No wifi!!!!!! In this day & age???? And, of course, they charge for it. And they charge for the use of the gym!!!!!! Seriously? How can you give your customer subpar accommodations & claim to be a luxury hotel?

The history, the people who have gone there before me, the beauty and grandeur of a time gone by, these are all things that draw me to historic places and hotels. The Palmer House Hilton is no exception. Its perfect location close to Millennium Park, nearby shopping, theaters and all that Chicago has to offer makes it a perfect choice when in Chicago. Built in 1871, the Palmer House still exudes the charm and grace of an era gone by. The lobby is breathtaking with it's soaring ceiling painted in 1900 (one of the most photographed ceilings in the world) and the gilded figurines done by Tiffany oh so many years ago. It's quite splendid. As for the rooms, they are okay. They have been upgraded over the years but know given the size of this hotel (over 1600 rooms) that this place gets alot of use so some areas feel a little worn out. On this visit- my room with the soaring ceilings had a large king bed (with some comfy linens) and the bathroom was recently redone. On the down side- there is no coffee maker in the room (it's a Hilton- what Hilton doesn't have free coffee?) they charge a daily fee for Internet use, the TV is bulky and old, there is no mini bar, and because it is an old building, the rooms can greatly vary in size. But here's a trick. If you want those big fluffy towels that I've come to expect from the nicer hotels, tip your housekeeper. The first day I was here- the towels and toiletries were functional but not fancy. Day 2, after I tipped the housekeeper? Sumptuous thick towels and upgraded toiletries. Coincidence? I think not! If you want a drink- try Potter's Bar. And for breakfast, lunch and dinner- Lockwood Restaurant located in the beautiful lobby is open. While there may be a line for weekend breakfast- tell the hostess that you are fine with the communal high top table and you will be seated immediately! Room rates vary so do a bit of negotiating and you should be able to get a competitive rate to other places in the city. And leave the car at home. Valet runs $61 a day (with in and out privileges) or you can park it yourself for about $15 less at one of the nearby parking garages (my favorite is one block south on Adams) It's a piece of Chicago history- still vibrant today. I love the photos of all the famous people who once played in the Empire Room that line the halls of this hotel. I love the opulence and grandeur that are the public spaces.

On my most recent visit, a rainy Friday after catching a preview exhibition at the Art Institute, the female server apparently couldn't be bothered. After ordering, it took a long time to get my drink (given that the crowd was moving more into dinner hour than happy hour), then again to get another round, and finally, the check, which another server, male this time, finally took care of. I would like to think that this lapse in service was not due to the fact that I was flying solo on this visit. There were also no snacks in evidence. Not certain if this is a new cost-cutting measure here or a sign of things to come.

When I was explaining my choice to some colleagues I told them that it used to be very elegant, but now was a little worn and frayed around the edges and the plumbing was a little iffy.  One of the younger members of the group said ""That sounds just like you, Dr. Rick"" to which someone added ""When the hell was Rick ever elegant?"". The service was perfect and the room, albeit small compared to newer hotels, was very comfortable and quiet.  I have a 3G wireless widget  for my computer, so I didn't have to pay for their expensive Internet connection.  A coffee pot would have been nice in the room, but there's a Starbucks on the street level.  All in all, my stay was pleasant and since it's so close to the museums and other downtown attractions I'd stay there again if I had more time to enjoy the city.",3,4,3,3,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

It was pretty much wine that was hot. I know it sounds weird, but it was really, really good. A must try if you go. My boyfriend drank like half of it because he also liked it so much. *Winter dream (absolut vanilla, st german, baileys, whipped cream, cinnamon): this drink was also good if you are a Baileys lover. I wish I had more of a Baileys hint to it though. It is sometimes hard to find seats here and my only complaint would be that I hate it when kids are taking up half the seats. For goodness sakes, it's a bar area and they don't drink, why the hell are they there?

Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location!  Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm.  Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.",4,3,1,0,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We were pretending to be delegates from the United Nations and we had a mock General Assembly with all the ad hoc committees and panels to boot. I was representing the US in the OAS (Organization of American States), and she was Argentina. We shared glances across the room, and as she spoke from the dais, I drooled. Now, I was an early bloomer they would say, and it was proven by my winning the coveted Congeniality Award upon our return from solving the world's problems (later this award would be renamed ""The Corey Hart Award""). Wink wink. Argentina and I had a quick love affair, skipping out of our small conference room to co-author resolutions on Cuba-US treaties and make out. It was in a cold Palmer House stairwell that I made it to second base, and it was in the not so private double room where we sealed the deal. Well, we almost sealed the deal. We were sadly interrupted by the pounding on the big and heavy Palmer House hotel room doors by the chaperone of my group. He was tipped off to the evil goings on inside the room by my roomie sulking outside in the hall. That rat! Well, needless to say, I've had a long long love for this hotel. It's been recently renovated, and through its renovation, never shut down! This they've done before, making it the longest continuously operating hotel in America. The hotel reclaims its older charms with this latest renovation, and the room upgrades were a welcome touch. A walk down the halls and you can see pictures of what the hotel looked like in the past, as well as catch glimpses of what kind of wild parties were going on back in the day. In the ballrooms, in the bars, and in the large large suites. The staff, service, and accompaniments are like any you'd find in a top notch Hilton property, and the location is great. Love blues? Then stay nowhere else, for here you're blocks away from Buddy Guy's Legends, a must visit. You're also close to the Chicago Theater, the landmark Marshall Field's (I refuse to refer to it as Macy's), and head toward the lake for access to parks, museums, and the South Loop's only Panda Express. Visiting in winter for Christmas? Walk West to find the christkindlmarket on Washington between Clark and Dearborn. There you'll find large, bright trees, a beer garden, and dozens of stalls peddling all sorts of Austrian, German, and Bavarian goods, gifts, and foods. I bring everyone I show around Chicago to the Palmer House, and it never disappoints. There's always oooohing, ahhhing, and wows. The majesty of the reception/foyer/seating/lobby area is well... simply timeless and breathless. This is an American icon without a doubt. Tip: steal your girl/guy away into a stairwell for me.

The only minor flaw in the whole experience was the breakfast.  It was fairly pricey given the quality of food served, but it was still good - and the atmosphere of their restaurant is very opulent, too.   Although I love sampling lots of different hotels in every city I visit, I would definitely return to the Palmer House on a future trip.",5,1,1,0,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

We stayed here for the sole purpose of sleeping - I didn't even get a chance to see the pool or anything else. We road tripped from Houston to Chicago to Niagara Falls all within a week!

We got settled in around 9 PM on a weekday, didn't know where to dine or what was open, so we just wandered and hoped to find something. Sadly, most restaurants were closed or closing by then and the few places I had wanted to eat (via Yelp reviews) were too far. I'm definitely researching more in advance next time! The bellhops were all really nice - taking bags to the room once we were settled in, storing our luggage, etc. I saw the receptionist offer everyone else in line bottled water - but didn't offer us any! Concierge was not helpful when we were trying to find information about Chicago Trolley tours. She just said ""wait at CVS and you'll see someone there."" No one was there! Luckily, the Palmer House is one of their stops and we were able to get on when it stopped at the light. The Corner Bakery Cafe is right next to the hotel, so we ate there for breakfast before going on our tour! I don't think I'll be paying $4 for a banana at the hotel restaurant anytime soon..

I had never been inside the place before then but had heard great things about it from friends. The lobby area is very ornate and elegant. It literally feels like you're walking into a gold mine or something. The rooms are a different story, however. It was very small, the beds were full size, which is something I had never seen in a [Hilton] hotel before. The bathroom has the be the smallest bathroom I've ever seen in my entire life. One person couldn't really be in there comfortably, forget about having two! Motel 6 has bigger bathrooms than this. The lighting is super poor and the view was terrible. What really turned me off was the staff at the hotel did not allow alcohol in the rooms. They made up some BS about licensing agreements and other legal mumbo jumbo, but really it was just an excuse for them to get more money out of people, because they said if they found alcohol in a room they were going to charge a ""cork fee"" of $60 per bottle. So, you're meaning to tell me that after already paying for a night in your hotel, plus paying to go to the party, you're going to charge me for having liquor that I PAID FOR MYSELF??? I don't think so! If I come back here, it won't be to stay. The event itself was very nice and the restaurants and lounges seemed posh, so I'd come back for those.",2,0,0,0,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

04-Oct-10,1BD_wVimZe3KhrCyV4GR5w,2uZEpLX3znS3WuIXMWWp6Q,"There's no Chicago luxe like late 19th century Chicago luxe. Because of it's uniqueness, beauty, and proximity to the Shedd Aquarium, we selected the Palmer House for our wedding weekend room block. I had been to the Palmer House for fabulous and fun events before, but never before stayed there. The special events staff is very easy to work with and quick to reply to emails. It seemed like our event kept changing hands, but that everyone seemed to know what was going on. We kept adding guests after our rate had supposedly ended, and they did it without fuss. One of those rooms was a room for me for Friday night, a reservation which I made myself with the special events manager. First impressions arriving were pretty good. If you are not valeting a car (which is really expensive) that needs to stand for about 10 minutes while you unload, I would highly recommend entering on the Monroe and NOT the Wabash side. The L passing overhead on Wabash is deafening. The porters brought out two carts to carry our suitcases and 6 dresses (for my mom, sister, and I for the rehearsal and the wedding). They told us to check in and get comfortable and they would bring it right up. They did, which was great service. Now when my sister and I got to the room, I was shocked to see how tiny it was.This was one of the older, not rehabbed rooms.  I mean, I know it's an old hotel, but still! I was calling as the bride for a 60-room wedding block and that was the best they had? I ended up hanging my dress from the air conditioning vent because the closet wasn't big enough for it, and we had to move it over like a curtain to exit the room. In terms of sleeping, I thought that the mattress in the room was too soft. You may think I was being a princess on the room size, but I definitely was not. The next morning, my sister/maid of honor forced me to ""sleep in"" (awoke at 5:30am -- sleep fail), and then she ordered us room service. When the server arrived, he said, ""Good morning -- wow, this is a small room!"" THAT's how you know it's a small room -- when the man who has probably seen half the hotel and who is probably coached on making you feel like a welcomed guest comments on it! Anyway, the deluxe oatmeal my sister got us was very good.   That afternoon, we checked into a suite. Wooooooooohooooo! Talk about an upgrade! For about twice the price, we got five times the space: two bathrooms, a master bedroom, a dining room, a full desk, a living room/TV space, and a half kitchen. It was completely redone, as was the entire 10th floor. It was the perfect space to cyclone through before your big day -- shoes all over the floor, flower boxes, bobby pins flying everywhere. That suite could handle it. I slept like a rock in there. The regular rooms being cleaned that I peeked into while going down the hallways also looked very nice. If you have the cash or are willing to splurge for a special occasion, I say do it! The rich, ornate lobby and city streets that surround the Palmer House are gorgeous and perfect for touring, entertainment, and for photography. The lobby bar serves some very good drinks, including a seriously decked-out Bloody Mary. One thing about the lobby bar though -- the bartenders were pretty creepy to me. Another friend described them as total jerks. We had reserved a separate suite for the wedding after-party, and that purpose was expressly communicated to the Palmer House. The hotel failed to move one very ornery guest next door to the suite who was complaining at 4pm about noise coming from the suite when 6 friends were watching a football game. So we knew there was going to be trouble later. Sure enough, at 1:00am when our guests come back, there's a knock on the door. 3 hotel staff tell us we have to stop. My husband flatly and loudly tells them that that's not a solution we'll accept because they knew the purpose of the room and they knew this guest who was complaining was a problem earlier. I also reminded them about the business we're driving to the hotel. Eventually, one of the staff persons gets the brilliant idea to take us down to one of the party/conference rooms on the lower level of the hotel.  Way to problem solve! We pick up all the champagne and music and follow him, and the party merrily continued on until 5:30am (sans me and Alex). The next morning, we had a nice farewell breakfast at the hotel. I would avoid anything on biscuits -- they were too buttery or something. The texture was off. We continued to lounge around in the hotel lobby with friends and family for about 2 hours after we checked out without hassle. Friends of ours who were staying in Chicago for several days but had checked out of the Palmer House that morning were able to leave their bags with the front desk for at least 24 hours.",4,1,0,0,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

The room had a desk and a chair, but no extra comfy chair. No dresser to store my clothing. The ice bucket and two glasses were stored in the closet because there was no room to put it. The flat screen tv was mounted on the wall but a whole in the wall where the cable comes from was right in the middle of the wall (tacky) including all the wires to the tv halfway hanging down from the tv. (tacky again).  The bathroom was ok, small but ok.     I order room service, a $12 cheeseburger and soda turned out to be $32 after state tax, city tax, room service fee, 18% gratuity for room service orders. And the guy acted like he wanted a tip when he brought in the tray. Seriously?? A soda in the vending machine was $2.50 and so was bottled water. Luckily there was a 7-elevan down the street for my late night cravings.     I put the do not disturb sign on the door because I wanted to sleep in late that next saturday morning. At 8am I am waken up by vacuuming by my door. Mind you the bed is close to the door. I felt like I was being punked. I guess do not disturb in only to keep the maids from knocking on your door.

From time to time unfortunate things happen, but some of the reviewers gave this hotel one star. Really, one star, are you kidding me? This is what one would consider to be a ""grand"" hotel. The second floor lobby is exquisite. The furniture is lavish, the ceiling will invite Sistine Chapel comparisons (ok, I am exaggerating), and the famous Empire Room will make you say ""Wow"" out loud. The hotel is replete with beautiful pictures of the great performers that once performed in the Empire Room. I saw pictures of Jack Benny, Pearl Bailey, and the most beautiful picture of Dorothy Jean Dandridge I have ever seen. Make sure that you take the time to see all of the beautiful black and white pictures. The second floor lobby also has free internet and plenty of tables and chairs if you want to avoid the internet fee, which, by the way, was very reasonable. My room was beautiful and classy. The bathroom was old-fashioned yet bright and the Peter Thomas Roth toiletries added a nice touch. The color combinations used on the curtains and bed linens made the room look elegant and I immediately felt that I received a bargain. The service was amazing. A very classy lady named Tatyana from Bulgaria checked me in. I told her I was excited to be there for my birthday and after a brief chat she upgraded my room. Two days later when I returned for the evening there was a nice bottle of wine with a wonderfully hand-written note thanking me for visiting and wishing me a happy birthday. I thought it was so cool that I saved the cork and the card is part of my screen saver collection. Efficiency accompanied by courtesy is a rare combination in today's world. The courtesy extended by Tatyana was impressive because of its rarity and its genuineness. The hotel is centrally located near the blue and red subway lines obviating the need for you to take a cab from Chicago's O'Hare airport. You can walk to Millennium Park, the Navy Pier, The Chicago Art Institute and there are good restaurants nearby like ""The Gage,"" the upscale ""Russian Tea Time"" or casual Bennigans. For your morning coffee go around the corner and have Dunkin Doughnuts! This is a fantastic hotel and I look forward to spending my next birthday there!",5,0,0,0,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I was prepared to ignore the fact that the gym costs extra. I usually love any hotel, so for me to take the time to write such a negative review means something is wrong. After I got home on Monday, I realized I had left a dress hanging in the closet in our room. I called right away, and they directed me to the Security/Lost and Found department. I was on hold for 20 minutes, and finally spoke with a woman there. I explained what had happened, gave my room number, described the dress, and provided my contact information. The woman told me that she would have someone check the room right away and call me back later in the day. She never called me back. I called again in the evening, and got a man on the phone. He told me that a couple had checked into the room and that they could not find out if the dress was in there until the next day. I called back on Tuesday, and they told me that the couple had checked out, and they would send someone to look for the dress, and then call me back. No call. Then I called a couple hundred more times, to no avail. On Wednesday, I had to leave the country for a week, so I made a last call from the airport, and was told they would check and call me back. Nothing. My girlfriend then called them for me on Friday and Saturday, without success, because another couple had checked in by that time, and apparently it was impossible to find out whether a dress was hanging in the closet before they arrived. Finally, a full week later, I called and got a man named Michael in the Security Department. He got someone to go to the room and look for my dress, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by that point. Michael apologized and told me that his supervisor was out of the office. I then asked to speak to a Customer Service representative. The hotel operator transferred me to a voicemail. When I called back, she transferred me to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman who informed me that the hotel ""doesn't have a Customer Service department"" and hung up on me. I called back one more time, was again transferred to the front desk, where I spoke with a woman named Nikita who told me that the front desk ""handles customer service."" She then transferred me to her supervisor's voicemail (Ms. Cruz), which stated, ""I am in the office all day but unable to take your call."" Is that even a thing? Every single time I called, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes at least. The total disregard for customer service was both ridiculous and time-consuming. I would encourage anyone who wants a smooth experience to avoid this hotel.",1,3,0,1,YR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

I love the architecture and how I feel like I'm stepping back into the 1940s-1950s whenever I walk the halls with the movie stars from one of the best eras in Hollywood. I've been here twice (though didn't stay the night-my mom did) and I can't wait to go back just to take it all in again. This time I went with my mom, boyfriend, and his mom to wander around and check out all the fancy stuff. There was a wedding reception and a prom going on, so we didn't see the smaller rooms, but we did venture into the Grand Ballroom, and boy was it ever grand! They don't call it that for nothing, let me tell you. The chandeliers were just gorgeous. We wandered all over and encountered the most beautiful piano I've ever seen. Sadly they'd locked it (too many people trying to play it, I imagine), so I didn't get to see what I'm sure are beautiful keys. Sigh. Maybe someday. I'm not entirely sure what Gene is talking about, I have yet to encounter a small room there.

When you call yourself ""THE Palmer House"" you are creating a allegiance to your brand.  You are failing to live up to the brand that was built for you many decades ago.  The fact that movies stars of years past would flock to your hotel simply based on the name and the brand that was built on SUPERIOR HOSPITALITY.  The hospitality recevied by those customer is absolutly a thing of the past.  Unfortunately, you have failed miserably to accomplish anything other than outstanding luggage service.  What a shame?  You are actually calling yourself, ""THE Palmer House"".  Boo Woo Woo, you are embarassing THE CITY OF CHICAGO. Just a note on how our company's corporate travel policy works.  Each week we are assigned a client to visit for 5 days.  We're generally given notice sometimes 3 days, sometimes 5 to7  days and sometimes weeks in advance notice. We're given a budget for just about everything, air, hotel and car + a daily food allowance and other incidentals like dry cleaning, fuel etc.  As contractors WE HAVE A CHOICE!!!!  The key is to create a pleasant and enjoyable experience for yourself in your home away from home. I am a contract technical trainer for a company that employs 15,000 other contract trainers.  (Notice no large caps in titling as it is not that important to me.  The important thing is to get the job done, and I am proud to say we do that!!)  In the 18 months of nonstop travel week to week all across the country I have only experienced the feeling of being so belittled and unwelcomed by a hotelier in the hospitality industry one other time and they will not get my repeat business either. It is a shame that I would have to interact with your hotel front desk via phone and front desk managers via phone and in person (Kim over the phone and Vera in person)  5 times and miss my check in and revise the reservation 3 times to accommodate your staff in the handling of a corporate preauthorization to pay for my stay (at your oh so fabulous facility).   When I told the front desk manager to note that I would pay for the first night or two out of my pocket was a moment of insanity for me.  After experiencing this cavalier attitude in person, I recall that I HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE.  Thank Goodness for that.   Thank you for giving me the OPTION TO CHOOSE!!!  I'll work as diligently as I can to stick with my normal policy of patronizing the local boutique hotels who live and die by their level of hospitality.  For example Kimpton Properties, YOU ROCK!!!     Vera, your front desk manager was so arrogant as to tell me she would have been doing me a favor in accepting the preauthorization.  However, as she put it, she couldn't even accept the preauthorization from me because it wasn't on 'your form' and the form wasn't turned in 1 week in advance of my stay.   I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a professional busines traveler and you don't work with business travelers. I don't know if I received this treatment because I'm a woman busines traveler and you don't work with women business travelers. I don't know if it's because I'm a human being with a heart and soul that should be treated with courteousy and respect, an you don't work with human beings. I don't know if it's because I'm a black travelers, and you don't work with black travelers. The Palmer House is definitely not my kind of place.  Your staff is cold, cavalier and fails to provide a business class of professional hospitality.   Good Luck!!! cc: Hilton Corporate HQ 7930 Jones Branch Drive McLean, Virginia 22102  USA cc:Yelp.com",1,1,0,2,NR,2m_KBLL9Bk_dwZ5n5b11nw

You walk into the hotel and the lobby is gorgeous, with an outstanding bar area and shopping area downstairs. However, after my 2 days I have to say my stay was completely miserable and at least Chicago had enough to offer to save my trip. The rooms are tiny and whoever came up with the design to put the tv at a 90 degree angle to the bed wasn't thinking very clearly. The bed was apparently a king, but definitely felt more like a queen. Now, a small room with a strange design doesn't get you 1 star, but watching an inch long cockroach walk around your bathroom at 7am in the morning after you wake up tends to ruin an experience. After spending 5 minutes smashing it with a metal trash can and STILL not fully killing it, your day just can never be the same. I went to the front desk before leaving for my business conference and the front desk person said that they would have a technician check the room for holes / infestations and would get me a new room set up. When I came back from work, the front desk had no record of me ever filing the complaint and no record of there being a cockroach in the room. So I had to retell my story and show them the picture of the massive insect. What scares me the most, is that how can you let a possible infestation just leak through the records? What if it was bed bugs (which if you google the hotel, clearly they have had issues) or something nastier than a cockroach? The front desk person went back into their managers area (for 15 minutes I was standing there waiting) and came back to let me know they had given me a new room further away from the elevator (as if that somehow means less chance of bugs or something) and 50 bucks in food coupons which only work at this EXACT hotel. The new room was nice and spacious, with a great view of the ventilation system on the 8th floor and a wall blocking anything else. To finish it off, I woke up the next morning with hives, either from something in the sheets or due to stress (I wonder what could have stressed me out). I literally and figuratively am allergic to the hotel. The rooms have nice amenities, but it can not hide the fact that the infrastructure is old and needs much better maintenance. The lack of customer service and hospitality, after knowing that I dealt with a miserable morning was also saddening.

Luckily it survived unscathed, but it wasn't the best beginning to the trip.  The lobby at the Palmer is always packed like the MGM Grand or something, and with all of the hotels in downtown Chicago I can't really figure out what the draw is.  There was no line at the check in desk despite the crowd, so we were able to get up to our room really quick.  Then we opened the door. Now when you book a room on Hotwire technically you aren't supposed to get many options, but we did book for two adults... and it's a big assumption on the part of the hotel that these two adults are married or a couple as only one person's name gets entered in.  So we were a bit shocked to see that inside our very tiny room was a single double bed.  I mean this the U S of A people... double beds should be legislated out of existence by now.  My wife calls down to the front desk asking to switch to a different room and is told we can't be moved until Sunday.  Then I call and we can magically get moved that very night.  Definitely happy about the move, not sure why the voice of a male was needed to make it happen. The rest of the experience continued to be pretty lackluster.  Every single morning we were there at around 8:30am the cleaning staff would gather outside the door to our room and from the sounds of it were conducting their staff meeting. Well, I'm not being serious about the meeting part, but they were seriously LOUD.  Want to sleep in at the Palmer?  You can forget about it. Also be prepared for all sorts of typical downtown Chicago hotel nickel and diming.  We didn't want to pay for the internet, so we decided we'd go down to hang out at the Starbucks inside the Palmer because all Starbucks have free wifi now.  Not this one.  Palmer shuts it down.
